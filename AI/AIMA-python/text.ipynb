    "Before we start performing text processing algorithms, we will need to build some word models. Those models serve as a look-up table for word probabilities. In the text module we have implemented two such models, which inherit from the `CountingProbDist` from `learning.py`. `UnigramTextModel` and `NgramTextModel`. We supply them with a text file and they show the frequency of the different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two models is that the first returns the probability of one single word (eg. the probability of the word 'the' appearing), while the second one can show us the probability of a *sequence* of words (eg. the probability of the sequence 'of the' appearing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, both functions can generate random words and sequences respectively, random according to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we build the two models. The text file we will use to build them is the *Flatland*, by Edwin A. Abbott. We will load it from [here](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-data/blob/a21fc108f52ad551344e947b0eb97df82f8d2b2b/EN-text/flatland.txt)."

    "We are given a string containing words of a sentence, but all the spaces are gone! It is very hard to read and we would like to separate the words in the string. We can accomplish this by employing the `Viterbi Segmentation` algorithm. It takes as input the string to segment and a text model, and it returns a list of the separate words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm operates in a dynamic programming approach. It starts from the beginning of the string and iteratively builds the best solution using previous solutions. It accomplishes that by segmentating the string into \"windows\", each window representing a word (real or gibberish). It then calculates the probability of the sequence up that window/word occuring and updates its solution. When it is done, it traces back from the final word and finds the complete sequence of words."
